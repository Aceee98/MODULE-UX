# Introduction
This document contains the suggestions, reasoning and possible solutions for possible changes within the proposed designs.
These suggestions are not final and may be both open for discussion but also subject to change based on feedback from external user testing.

The suggestions mentioned are based solely on the ideology put forward by the brief and place no limitations on the design itself. The suggestions should encorporate the best ideas from each team members designs and be effectively additive to the baseline design.



# Survey
This survey was conducted to understand peoples opinions on the designs of this project and to further enhance possible design choices made. Using these results, we hope to better the design, make it more accessible, user friendly and a generally better experience for the user.<br>
<b>Please note that the following document was heavily influenced by both the brief and these survey results.</b>
## Data Protection
A survey was conducted to an undisclosed number of people, the UK's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPA) was carefully followed to ensure no personal information was collected nor will be disclosed.
In accordance with this, the survey will be spoken about in a general sense, with no specific information about the participants, you may often hear the term "participants" or the phrase "a lot" (or alternatively "the majority") to describe the survey results and the general consensus of the participants.

## Results



# Team designs
The following section contains the general opinion of the team members on each others designs. <br>
These designs were made to be a combined design in the final product, as such the following section will contain the opinions of each team member on certain design aspects that some team members believed were particularly good or bad.

## Team member 1
Design 1 was made by **Aiswarya Jose**.

## Team member 2
Design 2 was made by **Carl Smith**.

## Team member 3
Design 3 was made by **Dillan Jones**.

## Team member 4
Design 4 was made by **Isah Davies**.

## Team member 5
Design 5 was made by **Suhayb Mohammed**.




# Qualities
The ideal qualities for the designs are a predetermined set of rules and qualities that are best adheared to, from the brief.
These design qualities are mostly prefrencial and subjective but are best followed to ensure a consistent, coherent and comprehensive design.

The qualities are as follows:
- **Simple** - The design should be simple enough for most people to comprehend, not overly complex not anything that should require technical prowess to understand.
- **Clean** - The design should be clean and should remain simple to navigate, with no unnecessary design choices to ensure a smooth experience.
- **Functional** - The design should include mostly functional components, with little to no unnecessary or superfluous design choices.
- **Readable** - The design should be readable for people of all ages, this includes (but is not limited to) text, images and even backgrounds. This is to ensure the app is accessible to all target audiences regardless of age or reading ability.
- **Consistent** - The design should be consistent, with consistency comes ease of use and simplicity, with less of a learning curve, therefore ensuring more users return to the app.


# Suggestions
## Suggestion 1: **Remove filters and sorting**
### Reasoning
The map page contains options to filter and sort parking spaces by price, distance and much more, and while these features may be useful in neich cases, they are often unnecessary and can be both overwhelming and cluttered.

The map system itself provides enough filtering and sorting options in the form of the ability to select an area and scroll through a list seeing proximity, price and address.

This point is further enhanced by the idea that by simply using the list of parking spaces, the user is able to see each space and select the best space they believe to be both in close proximity to their destination and its most affordable/appropriate price.

# Suggestion 2: **Simplify the map search page**
### Reasoning
The current map search page contains a list of parking spaces, along with reviews, distance, price, open/closed status and 4 buttons, and the name of the location, all in a relatively small space.
This may be very overwhelming for some people and possibly cause a longer search time as they attempt to find the price or distance while scrolling through the list amongst the other information.

### How to improve
A possible way to improve may be to remove all buttons, and remove the open/closed status as well as the reviews, this would ensure that the only visible information on each entry is the name of the location, distance and price, which allows for quick and easy access to the important information. 

| Item         | Position on Screen                     | Information      | Alignment           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Location Name** | Top of the overlay | N/A | Centered |
| **Rating** | Below the title, far left | A rating out of 5 for the location, specified by Google reviews | Left-aligned |
| **Distance** | Below the title, right of the rating | Displays the distance to the location from the users position | Right-aligned |
| **Price** | 20-30% down the screen, possibly centered | N/A | Centered |
| **Buttons** | The button can be the whole entry itself | Clicking the button will open a popup | N/A |
| **Favourite/Save** | Positioned to the right of the title | Bookmark icon | Centered/Side |


# Suggestion 3: **Add accessibility settings**
### Reasoning
The app should be accessible to as many people as possible, adding accessibility options will allow for users to change things such as font size, background and/or font colours and will allow for a more inclusive experience.

For people with disabilities or difficulties, accessibility options will allow for more a more comfortable, easier and generally better experience on the app and will vastly expand the demographic of people who can use the app.
### How to improve
In the settings popout, add a new option to view accessibility settings, which will open a page similar to privacy settings, but with options to change font size (default size with a - to the left and + to the right), background colour (dropdown with a select few options) and font colour (dropdown with a select few options).
